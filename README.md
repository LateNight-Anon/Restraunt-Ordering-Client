# Important information
This project is complete as part of a school assignment for year 10 IT. Because of this, despite the 'alpha build' like nature of it I (most likely) won't be adding functionality for cross device connections (i.e servers), improve the UI past what basic Tkinter allows, use proper images in the bathroom section of core.py or add any new functionality once the program is finished.

# Restraunt Ordering Client
This repository contains the source code for 2 pieces of software desiged to work together in a restraunt environment.

### core.py **:** Customer Software
Core.py is the main piece, meant to fill a similar place to the ordering terminals in McDonalds; it takes its basic functionality and combines it with the ability to call a waiter to your table, open a map to the bathroom and pay with split billing.

### waiter.py **:** Waiter Assistance Software
Waiter.py is designed to be used by staff, it shows a live feed of what tables need assistance and allows
the user to check off tables once they've been served. There is currently an error generated by a thread once
the program is closed however this doesnt affect the functionality and will most likely never be seen in an
actual work environment.

# Example Files and Definitions of Data
The files in the example files folder contains a copy of all the non-code files in the form I was using to test to the software along with a text file showing where the files should be placed for all pieces of software to work

### Files:
- bathroom.png: the image used in the 'Bathroom' section of the software
- bleep.mp3 **:** default error noise
- tables.json **:** contains the data for all tables (if they need assistance and too what severity), waiter.py and core.py communicate through this file
- foodItems.json **:** contains the definitions for each item in the menu
- closeMessage.txt **:** contains the message shown on the popup question when closing the app
- tableNumber.csv **:** contains the table number of whatever table this is installed in
- minAndMaxSev.csv **:** contains the minimum and maximum severity rating a user can input when asking for assistance

### Error Codes / IDs:
- 001 **:** tables.json file is missing
- 002 **:** tableNumber.csv is missing
- 003 **:** tableNumber.csv is incorrectly configured (it's not an integer (see tableNumber.csv in the example files))
- 004 **:** moveObjectsOnCanvas function has been modified
- 005 **:** foodItems.json file is missing
